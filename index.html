                Hello everyone, I am Rose Valencia Siahaan, a third-semester student from Advent University Indonesia, Faculty of Information Technology, Major in Information Systems. I am a woman with a multifaceted personality (just like typical women). Why I chose to display this photo of a young child? She is Anya Forger, a character from SPY x FAMILY. This little girl teaches values such as empathy, courage, and the importance of teamwork. With her ability to read minds, Anya demonstrates how crucial it is to understand other people's feelings. She bravely helps her family despite her young age, reminding us that courage can come from anyone. Her cheerful demeanor and curiosity encourage us to seek happiness and learning, while her interactions with her family emphasize the importance of collaboration and self-acceptance.
